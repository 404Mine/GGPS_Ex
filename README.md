Welcome to Grade Generator Per Student Exercise!

It's an Exercise from Someone and they asked me to help!
The original code is kinda messy having multiple loops so i instead did two loops to get user input names and user input grades per names!
With the help of array and variables to store grades + a switch case. It all went Smoothly!!!
I'm glad I was able to finish this from scratch i'm so dead z.z

If you found any bugs/erros/trouble or if i were able to help Leave a Message!
